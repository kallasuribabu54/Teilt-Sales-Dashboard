## Problem Statement

Teilt, a business with operations expanding across multiple countries, was struggling with the increasing complexity of its operations. Despite their rapid growth, the company was relying heavily on Excel for data analysis, which was time-consuming, more error's, and lacked scalability. This caused inefficiencies in decision-making and led to significant financial losses due to the inability to extract meaningful insights from their data in real time.


### Objectives

The primary objective of this project was to transition Teilt from its outdated Excel-based data analysis process to a more efficient and scalable solution: Power BI. The goal was to develop an interactive, dynamic, and integrated Power BI dashboard capable of providing real-time insights, improving operational efficiency, and empowering decision-makers at all levels of the business with actionable data.
